**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

**Personally, I think this is something that everyone will develop over time. You need to figure out what works best for you. For me, taking things like user stories and other feedback methods and compiling them into an easy to digest list is the first step. From there, I would sort them according to time and resources reqired to complete with a seperate category for anything that may require an immediate fix to be acted upon first. With everything sorted and the high priority items tackled, I can begin to work on things based off priority in descending order. 

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

**Before this course, I would give myself an estimate for the amount of time it would take a project to complete and break that up among the amount of days I had to complete the project with a final day for testing and correction before submission. After taking this course, my approaches have changed with more of a agile mindset. Breaking up everything into more easy to handle sections instead of simply going from beginning to end. Utilizing managemtn practices like a itemization list help maintain the time management that I prioritize so highly. Running frequent tests between development items and correcting as problems arise has really streamlined the entire process. 

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

**I think communication is the key for a development team. Making it clear where you stand in a project and bringing anything relevant to the team's attention greatly increases workflow. It is important when working as a team that all members can easily see what items each other member is working on. It all plays into communication. With communication comes time management and completion without redundancies.
